## Quick Facts
- 📚 Undergraduate Student @ University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" book.
- 👯 Interested in collaborating on any project. Seriously, programming is a huge area and I'd like to see all that I can.
- 🌏 Born in Samar, Philippines. Grew up in the islands of Samar and Cebu. 
- 🏠 Living in the Rio Grande Valley, USA.
- ⚡Fun fact:
  I am super interested in spoken languages!
  I can speak Waray-waray, English, and --if you're patient-- Spanish. I also understand Tagalog and Cebuano, but my speaking skills a little rusty.
  I'm interested to learn either Brazilian Portuguese or Swedish once I'm satisfied with my Spanish.
